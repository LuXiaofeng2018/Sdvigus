% 1. each zone is specified by the following format:

%    material of the zone; zone will be filled with particles of this type
% 3. 'constraints' are vectorized anonymous functions determining 
%    area of the zone and having the following format: @(x, y)( ... )
%    for some point (x, y) function has to return 1 if this point is 
%    inside the zone and 0 otherwise
% 4. if there are no constraints the zone will be equal to the whole domain
