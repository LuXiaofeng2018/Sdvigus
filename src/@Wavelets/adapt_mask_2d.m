function mask = adapt_mask_2d(fmat, jmax, jmin, balance_grid, refine_fully, eps)
% Grid adaptation is performed for 2D field given by values 'fmat', which was
% previously linearly transformed from level 'jmax' to level 'jmin'.
% The new adapted grid is returned via 'mask' and contains: significant
% nodes (as prescribed by 'eps'), adjacent to significant nodes, nodes at
% all levels which are necessary to compute these significant and adjacent
% nodes (reconstruction check criterion), and all nodes at lowest (coarsest)
% level (c-coefficients). If 'balance_grid' is true the grid also will include
% nodes to balance it, i.e. there will be no boundaries between levels which
% differ by more than 1. If 'refine_fully' is true there will be no partially 
% refined cells, i.e. if at least one sub-cell in some cell is refined - all 
% other sub-cells in this cell also will be refined (this ensures grid 
% consistency in case of 2nd order elements).
